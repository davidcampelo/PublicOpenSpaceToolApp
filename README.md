# POST for Android
Android app for measuring the quality of POSTs (Public Open Space Tool)

The POST (Quality of Public Open Space Tool) is a well-established and validated tool designed for auditing public open spaces such as parks and other greenspaces, with particular emphasis on the physical attributes that may either encourage or discourage their use for physical activity. The POST relies on direct observation and it is composed of 49 items covering four key domains: activities, environmental quality, comfort, and safety.

This App was developed by Instituto de Sa√∫de Publica da Universidade do Porto (ISPUP) and by the Centre for the Built Environment and Health of the University of Western Australia based on the original paper version of POST. 

Besides the user-friendly interface, this electronic version now includes other functionalities, namely storing data, mapping features, and exporting the database with the audit results.
